	<h1>Open positions</h1>
	<h2>PhD position in deep learning for medical image analysis</h2>
	<ul>
		<h3><p>Applications are invited for a fully funded PhD position at the ETS, Montreal, Canada. ETS is the fastest-growing and largest engineering school in Quebec, with an expanding team of highly qualified young researchers in image analysis, computer vision and deep learning, some of the priority areas of the school.

<p>The position is available after the candidate passes ETS application requirements and the candidate will start at her/his convenience (latest at winter 2020). Financial support is available for 4 years. This project will explore learning strategies when annotated data is scarce, with the goal of understanding and interpreting medical image data efficiently, with a main focus on image segmentation. The successful candidate will work under the supervision of Prof. Jose Dolz.

<p>Prospective applicants should have:
Strong academic record with an excellent M.Sc. degree (or equivalent) in computer science, applied mathematics, or electrical/biomedical engineering, preferably with expertise in more than one of the following areas: medical image analysis, machine learning, computer vision, pattern recognition, semi/weakly supervised learning and/or optimization;
Experience with a deep learning framework (preferably PyTorch, or Tensorflow).
Research experience in computer vision, machine learning or image processing is also desirable.
Publications in a peer-reviewed journal or conference in a related topic is a bonus.

<p>For consideration, please send a full CV, names and contact details of two references, transcripts for graduate studies, and a link to a M.Sc. thesis (as well as relevant publications if any) to:

<p>jose.dolz@etsmtl.ca
